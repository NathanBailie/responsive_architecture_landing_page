# Description

This Gulp template is designed to automate the build process of a web project. It includes various tasks for both development and final project build.

I used the [starter template](https://github.com/YauhenKavalchuk/Starting_template 'click') by Yauhen Kavalchuk as the basis. I rewrote the code in ECMAScript, replacing `gulp.task()` with functions, made some changes to the code structure for better readability and maintainability, and added two modes: development and production build.

## Project launch

```
npm install - install dependencies
gulp dev - starts gulp in development mode

```
